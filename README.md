Project Overview

This project explores a real-world Movie Dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover insights about movie performance, audience ratings, genres, and correlations between key features.

The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), create visualizations, and build a simple recommendation-based insight system that highlights trends in the movie industry.

🧠 Objectives

Analyze movie data to find patterns and trends.

Identify top 10 movies by revenue and genres by average rating.

Study correlations between budget, revenue, popularity, and vote counts.

Present findings with attractive charts and a professional report.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Python 3.11+

Pandas → Data cleaning and analysis

NumPy → Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook → Analysis environment

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing values and converted data types.

Converted release_date to datetime format.

Changed numeric columns like budget, revenue, and popularity to float.

Filtered invalid or missing records to improve accuracy.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1️⃣ Top 10 Highest Revenue Movies

Visualized the movies that earned the most revenue — Avatar, Titanic, The Avengers lead the list.

2️⃣ Top 10 Genres by Average Rating

Genres like Animation, History, and Drama show the highest viewer satisfaction.

3️⃣ Correlation Heatmap

Strong correlation observed between Budget and Revenue, suggesting higher investments often lead to higher returns.

💡 Key Insights

High-budget movies generally earn higher revenue.

Viewer popularity and vote counts strongly influence movie success.

Certain genres consistently achieve better audience ratings.

Data visualization makes trends clear and actionable.
